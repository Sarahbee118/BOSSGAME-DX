To make this mod aLL of the assets from BOSSGAME were ripped by me using UABE and AssetRipper. 
Therese were then converted into PNGs. 
Then these PNGs were recolored in the app Procreate.
These colored version where reconverted into Unity Assests. 
Those assets were reinserted into the game's data folder.
(And for Android the APK was rebuilt using Android Studio Editor)
